This repository demonstrates the use of dynamic result types in C#. It implements a flexible result pattern that can handle various outcomes, such as success or failure, with detailed error handling. This approach helps to standardize how methods return results and handle errors, ensuring cleaner and more predictable code. The repository is a practical resource for developers aiming to improve error management and result handling in their applications.
